# 4phase-saperator
This is a model of a separator system used in the petroleum industry. Raw sample oil flows into the system and is separated into Gas, Oil, Water and Sand.

# important
this model is still in development. I will push updates weekly from now weekly till its done.

# Required
Visual Studio 19 preferably, but since its backwards compatible any choice between 15 and 17 should work
Netframe work 4.1, or just update your netframe work, should work fine

# Skills
Good knowledge in C# is needed to understand this code. 

# preview
this project has over thousand lines of code
